We need to parse the transcript: list participants: David Anyanwu, Emika? Actually it's "Emeka Obi". Also "Chioma Ude", "Ada Nnaji". Maybe multiple others? No.

Key discussion points:
- Review of Loyal Link platform progress.
- Backend integration with Supabase completed; OTP verification works.
- Design pages ready (landing, account creation, OTP verification) aligned with brand.
- Marketing content prepared: platform overview, loyalty program, onboarding video script.
- Blocker: delay of business registration data storage; currently using localStorage, need reliability across browsers.
- Cross-browser testing plan: Chrome, Edge, Firefox.
- Need onboarding video highlight point transfer system.
- Align visuals with UI designs.
- Sprint priorities: finish cross-browser testing, finalize onboarding video draft, prepare hackathon slides with dashboard & loyalty system visuals.
- Demo point transfers for hackathon.
- Add UI mockups/screenshots.
- Schedule mid-week review session on Wednesday 3 PM.

Decisions: 
- Prioritize cross-browser testing of OTP & registration flow.
- Finalize onboarding video draft.
- Prepare hackathon presentation slides visualizing dashboard and loyalty system.
- Emeka will prepare point transfer demo for hackathon slides.
- Chioma will add UI mockups and screenshots.
- Schedule review session for Wednesday at 3 PM.
- Meeting adjourned.

Unresolved issues/pending decisions:
- Reliability of temporary storage in localStorage across browsers (needs testing).
- Confirmation that cross-browser testing passes (pending).
- Possibly finalization of onboarding video still ongoing.
But constraints: Unresolved issues: Business registration data storage solution; ensuring cross-browser functionality.

Risks/concerns:
- Potential unreliability of storing business registration data in localStorage across browsers.
- Delay if cross-browser testing not done properly.
- Risk of not having video ready before hackathon.
Identify main topics: Platform progress update, technical implementation (backend integration, OTP), design updates, marketing / onboarding video, sprint planning, hackathon preparation, testing, scheduling next review.

Now produce JSON accordingly.

Let's craft arrays.

participants: ["David Anyanwu","Emeka Obi","Chioma Ude","Ada Nnaji"].

keyPoints array summarises each bullet.

decisions… include those.

unresolvedIssues = maybe list.

risks = list.

topics = list.

meetingSummary string about 2-3 sentences.

Make sure valid JSON: no trailing commas, double quotes.

Now compose.

Check grammar, use proper JSON.

Potential decisions:

- Completion order prioritized: cross-browser testing, onboarding video, hackathon slides.
- Assignments: Emeka (point transfer demo), Chioma (UI mockups), Ada (video alignment), David supervises.
- Schedule review session Wednesday 3 PM.
- Adjourn meeting.

Include those decisions.

Ok produce.
