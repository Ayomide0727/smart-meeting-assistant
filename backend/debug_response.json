  "rawTranscript": "\nDavid Anyanwu: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Let’s get started. Today’s agenda is to review the Loyal Link platform progress, discuss any blockers, and finalize tasks for the upcoming sprint.\n\nEmeka Obi: Sure. On the development side, the backend integration with Supabase is complete. OTP verification for account creation and password reset works as expected.\n\nChioma Ude: On the design front, the landing page, account creation page, and OTP verification pages are ready for review. I’ve made sure the color scheme and fonts match the brand guidelines.\n\nAda Nnaji: For marketing, I’ve prepared the content for the platform overview and the loyalty program. I also drafted a short video script for onboarding new users.\n\nDavid Anyanwu: Great. Emeka, any blockers on your side?\n\nEmeka Obi: The only issue is delaying the business registration data until after email verification. Right now, I’m storing it temporarily in localStorage, but I want to make sure that works reliably across browsers.\n\nChioma Ude: I can test the flow on Chrome, Edge, and Firefox to confirm.\n\nDavid Anyanwu: Perfect. Ada, for the onboarding video, make sure it highlights the point transfer system — users should understand they can share points.\n\nAda Nnaji: Got it. I’ll align the visuals with Chioma’s UI designs so it matches the interface.\n\nDavid Anyanwu: For the sprint, let’s prioritize:\n\nComplete cross-browser testing of the OTP and registration flow.\n\nFinalize the onboarding video draft.\n\nPrepare hackathon presentation slides with visuals of the dashboard and loyalty system.\n\nEmeka Obi: I’ll also prepare a small demo showing point transfers for the hackathon slides.\n\nChioma Ude: I can add the UI mockups and screenshots for that.\n\nDavid Anyanwu: Excellent. Any other concerns?\n\nAda Nnaji: I suggest we schedule a review session mid-week to check progress on all fronts before the final presentation.\n\nDavid Anyanwu: Agreed. Let’s set that for Wednesday at 3 PM. If there’s nothing else, we’ll adjourn. Thanks, everyone, for your updates.\n\nMeeting Adjourned: 3:15 PM\n"
